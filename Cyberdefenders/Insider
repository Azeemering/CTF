~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scenario:
After Karen started working for 'TAAUSAI,' she began to do some illegal activities inside the company. 'TAAUSAI' hired you to kick off an investigation on this case.

You acquired a disk image and found that Karen uses Linux OS on her machine. Analyze the disk image of Karen's computer and answer the provided questions.

First thing first. I loaded the FirstHack.ad1 image in FTK imager. ()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Questions:

#1	What distribution of Linux is being used on this machine?

You can do all sorts of fancy stuff like mounting and catting for versions but the answer is right in front of your eyes in the /roor/boot/ directory.
This contains 4 files:
config-4.13.0-kali1-amd64
initrd.img-4.13.0-kali1-amd64
System.map-4.13.0-kali1-amd64
vmlinuz-4.13.0-kali1-amd64

Flag <Kali>

#2 What is the MD5 hash of the apache access.log?

Where are logs stored normally? var/log right?
The access.log is stored under var/log/apache2/access.log
Export this file's has and you have the flag.

Flag <d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e>

#3	It is believed that a credential dumping tool was downloaded? What is the file name of the download?

~Let's not waste time. 
Check root/Downloads

Flag <mimikatz_trunk.zip>

#4 There was a super-secret file created. What is the absolute path?

Looking for the file I found remnants of the SuperSecretFile.txt file in the Trash at root/.local/share/Trash/info so it must have been deleted.
æj
........Àj
.è.......Ïj
.Ü...SuperSecretFile.txt...

So moving on to check the history of what happened. Go to root/.bash_history you will find the following lines in the history of commands:
touch snky snky > /root/Desktop/SuperSecretFile.txt
cat snky snky > /root/Desktop/SuperSecretFile.txt 

Flag < /root/Desktop/SuperSecretFile.txt>


#5	What program used didyouthinkwedmakeiteasy.jpg during execution?

We are already in the bash history (root/.bash_history) from the previous question. When you examine the rest of the history you see the entries:

history > history.txt
binwalk didyouthinkwedmakeiteasy.jpg 

Flag <binwalk>

#6	What is the third goal from the checklist Karen created?

Go to root/Desktop there is a file called checklist that contains:

Check List:

- Gain Bob's Trust
- Learn how to hack
- Profit

Flag <Profit>

#7 How many times was apache run?

Check the logs again under var/log/apache2. There are 3 files:

Name                          Size
access.log                    0kb
error.log                     0kb
other_vhosts_access.log       0kb

Assuming that no logs where ever cleared it never actually ran.

Flag <0>

#8	It is believed this machine was used to attack another. What file proves this?

Browsing arround the file system I found a file screenshot of a remote desktop session to another computer...this must be the flag.

Flag </root/irZLAohL.jpeg>

#9	Within the Documents file path, it is believed that Karen was taunting a fellow computer expert through a bash script. Who was Karen taunting?


Looking in the bash history you see the user played around with scripting:

cd Documents/
mkdir myfirsthack
cd myfirsthack/
touch hellworld.sh
vim hellworld.sh 
chmod +x hellworld.sh 
./hellworld.sh 
touch firstscript
vim firstscript 
chmod +x firstscript 
etc etc

It contains references to a dir called myfirsthack. Browsing around in root/Documents/myfirsthack there is a file called firstscript_fixed that contains:

echo "Showing you your current path"
pwd
echo "Show my default route"
ip route | grep --color default
echo "Show network connections w/ port 80"
netstat | grep --color 80
echo "Heck yeah! I can write bash too Young"

The only word that stands out here is Young....

Flag <Young>

#10	A user su'd to root at 11:26 multiple times. Who was it?

Where are the logs again.....var/log/auth.log contains all authentications related loggins.

Looking at the time 11:26:

Mar 20 11:26:22 KarenHacker su[4060]: Successful su for postgres by root
Mar 20 11:26:22 KarenHacker su[4060]: + ??? root:postgres

Flag <postgres>

#11	Based on the bash history, what is the current working directory?

Back to the bash history:

ls
cd ../root
cd ../root/Documents/myfirsthack/../../Desktop/
sl
ls
cd ../Documents/myfirsthack/


Flag < /root/Documents/myfirsthack/>
